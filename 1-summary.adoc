=== Requirements & Research Motivation
This experiment was designed to demonstrate how current ICT-based tools can be applied together to allow better citizen participation in CS projects and enable better reuse of the data gathered. Citizen Science is highly transdisciplinary and heterogeneous by nature, and current standardization efforts already occur in the OGC (e.g. addressing data model and sharing issues) as well as outside the OGC (primarily addressing project descriptions and data set metadata). Citizen Science projects might benefit from concrete examples  and best practices  required to achieve the full benefits of interoperability. OGC is in the ideal position to develop and provide such best practice guidance to the international community. Developed solutions in this IE should be applicable to most Citizen Science projects. Findings from this IE will be generalized in this manner and might set the basis for additional experimentation in the future.

The FP7 Citizen Observatory Web (COBWEB) project was the first to propose the use of SWE in CS. This work resulted in an OGC public discussion paper available on the OGC website (OGC 16-129). The discussion paper describes a data model for the standardized exchange of citizen science sampling data based on SWE standards. This discussion paper was the initial motivation for this IE.

On the other hand, the Citizen Science Association’s International Working Group on Citizen Science Data and Metadata that developed the (PPSR-Core), the European Citizen Science Association (ECSA) has a working group that recognizes the value of standardization in the CS activities (supported by a COST Action). However, these activities could benefit from some experimentation that would be able to suggest common best practices while recognizing the particularities and current approaches in different thematic domains, such as biodiversity monitoring. Citizen Science can complement authoritative in-situ observations and fill the information gaps in numerous scientific disciplines that could be essential for informed decision making. In that sense, the way Citizen Science can be integrated into The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) (including GEOSS-Data Core as the pool to promote and share open and free data) is still under investigation.

The 'Ecosystem of Citizen Observatories (CO) for Environmental Monitoring' — WeObserve project is a Horizon 2020 funded project focused on improving the coordination between existing COs and related regional, European and international activities. WeObserve tackles three key challenges that face COs: awareness, acceptability and sustainability. The CoP3 is about Interoperability of Citizen Science projects. WeObserve project – via its CoP activities – has represented an opportunity to promote interoperability experiment in collaboration with the OGC. Such collaboration would address  questions raised in the SWE4CS discussion. In addition, it offers the possibility to directly feed the results into the OGC relevant standards and promotes their usage within GEOSS (as an important user community of OGC standards).

In anticipation of the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020, Earth Day Network, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and the U.S. Department of State, through the Eco-Capitals Forum, announce Earth Challenge 2020, a Citizen Science Initiative. This initiative is in collaboration with Connect4Climate – World Bank Group, Conservation X Labs, Hult Prize, National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE), Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), Reset, SciStarter, UN Environment and others to be announced. Earth Challenge 2020 will help engage millions of global citizens in collecting one billion data points in areas including air quality, water quality, biodiversity, pollution and human health. Earth Change 2020 data will be shared through the GEOSS Portal.

=== Prior-After Comparison
(( This section shall provide a prior-after comparison. It describes the situation/status of discussion in the OGC working groups being most relevant for the addressed topic. This part is reviewed in close detail by the appropriate SWG/DWG to ensure that the latest developments have been considered. The section will be complemented at the end of the initiative by comparing the results documented in the ER with the original situation. ))

=== Recommendations for Future Work
This OGC Interoperability Experiment ended on June 2019, but a second IE is foreseen for next year.

New possible topics for next IE to be discussed among the members include the following:

● There is a need for clarifying how to coordinate infrastructures for citizen science in Europe, and adopt standard procedures for data sharing and single sign on. Solving this issue will help in connecting CitSci to GEO. Steffen Fritz (IIASA) has proposed a side event in the next EuroGEOSS workshop to discuss this with the relevant players. This is emerging as a new activity in the WeObserve Interoperability Community of Practice that is related but not directly connected to the IEs.

● The WMO (World Meteorological Organization) is concerned about the amount of different CitSci activities that are being organized by meteorological organizations. It is looking for ways of taking advantage of this new data stream but problems of standardization of what is measured and how data is being shared arise. WMO has detected the potential of these data streams and would like to harmonize the situations to make data more useful for weather predictions in the future.

● OGC is promoting a new generation of web services based on OpenAPI. It is unclear how this could impact the use of OGC standards by CitSci projects but it is seen as an opportunity to make OGC standards more usable and compatible with IT mainstream. A hackathon to develop OGC API specifications is organized on June 20-21 in London.

The definition of the follow up IE will start in June when the first one will finalize and the ER is produced.


(( This section should answer the question: What does this ER mean for the Working Group and OGC in general? What aspects shall be addressed next? In any specific order? What actions are necessary? ))

(( This is a write up for why this ER should be important to the working group and OGC. This paragraph provides recommendations on how to further proceed with the achievements documented in this ER. ))
