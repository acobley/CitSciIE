[[SOS STA Models]]
== SOS and O&M  Experience
The last ER had some experience but ther was one missing that came later.

=== Earth Challance experince and recomendations
The 52Â°North STA comprises...

=== Status with STA and useful queries
It is important to know how to use $expand, $select, $filter, $count=true ...

https://developers.sensorup.com/docs/#query-filter

We need to tell people how to say "I only want frogs":
https://cos4cloud.demo.secure-dimensions.de/sta4cs/v1.0/Datastream?$expand=Observations&$filter=Observations/Datastream/ObservedProperty/name eq 'Taxon' and Observations/result eq 'Frog'

That is important to get the positions? Location (Thing), FeatureOfInterest? Having the two is a good thing but sometimes it gests complicated to know what is what.
We need those use cases where they are the same and cases where they are not.

https://cos4cloud.demo.secure-dimensions.de/sta4cs/v1.0/FeatureOfInterst?$expand=feature/geometry,Observations&$filter=st_within(feature,geography'POLYGON((0 0, 10 0, 10 10, 0 10, 0 0))')

https://cos4cloud.demo.secure-dimensions.de/sta4cs/v1.0/Observations?$filter=st_within(FeatureOfInterest/feature,geography%27POLYGON((0%200,%2010%200,%2010%2010,%200%2010,%200%200))%27)

=== Possible extension for STA
STA does not consider de Citizen directly (only things)... Motivations (use cases, requirements) and what is out there.
The integration is done in GBIF manually and is made available in yet another API (https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary). But others cannot integrate easily.
